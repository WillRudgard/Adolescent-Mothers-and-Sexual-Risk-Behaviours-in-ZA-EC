This repository contains the code used for the analysis in Rudgard & Cluver et al. (2022), accessible via DOI: jia2.25928. The code includes all Stata syntax necessary to reproduce the regression results presented in the manuscript. One syntax file reproduces the analysis among all adolescent girls and young women, while the other focuses on those who are sexually active. To run the code, you will need the data file from the HEY BABY study, as described in the methods section of the paper. The data can be requested by contacting William Rudgard at william.rudgard@spi.ox.ac.uk.
